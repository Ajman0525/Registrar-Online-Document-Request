# Registrar: Online-Doc-Req System

The Registrar: ODR system is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of requesting academic documents. It allows students to submit document requests, monitor their status, and receive notifications once their documents are ready. By digitizing the request process, the system reduces manual workload, improves efficiency, and provides a more convenient experience for both students and registrar staff.
