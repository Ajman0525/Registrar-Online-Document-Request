- **Precedence Order: Time → Date → Day**
- If outside allowed time → Block request immediately (highest priority)
- If date is marked unavailable → Block request regardless of day
- If date is marked available → Allow request regardless of day
- If no date restrictions set → Use existing day/time logic only
