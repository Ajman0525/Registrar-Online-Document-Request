# Admin Documentation Plan

## Information Gathered
After analyzing the entire admin codebase, I've identified 7 main admin tabs with comprehensive functionality:

1. **Dashboard Tab** - Statistical overview and activity monitoring
2. **Authentication Tab** - Admin authentication and user management
3. **Manage Request Tab** - Complete request lifecycle management
4. **Document Management Tab** - Document and requirement management
5. **Logging Tab** - System activity logging and monitoring
6. **Settings Tab** - System configuration and restrictions
7. **Transactions Tab** - Financial tracking and payment management

## Documentation Structure
Each documentation file will include:
- **Purpose & Overview**: What the tab does and its role in the system
- **Features**: Complete list of features available
- **Data Models**: Database models and relationships
- **Backend Implementation**: Controllers and API endpoints
- **Frontend Features**: User interface and interaction patterns
- **Key Functionality**: Detailed explanation of core features
- **Integration Points**: How it connects with other modules

## Plan
1. Create individual documentation files for each of the 7 admin tabs
2. Ensure each file comprehensively covers models → controllers → frontend flow
3. Use plain language explanations without code examples
4. Place all files in the Documentation folder for easy access

## Expected Deliverables
- 7 comprehensive markdown documentation files
- Each file covering one admin tab completely
- Clear explanation of implementation from database to user interface
